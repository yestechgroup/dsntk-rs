# Sector Risk Assessment

Evaluates the risk associated with the applicant's business sector,
adjusted for business maturity and financial strength. Uses **UNIQUE**
hit policy.

Certain sectors carry inherently higher risk due to cyclicality,
regulatory exposure, or market conditions. The accounts quality
provides a secondary signal — self-certified accounts in a high-risk
sector compound the uncertainty.

Rule 21 catches any sector where the accounts are self-certified — this
always elevates risk regardless of sector strength. Rule 22 catches
extreme leverage in any sector.
