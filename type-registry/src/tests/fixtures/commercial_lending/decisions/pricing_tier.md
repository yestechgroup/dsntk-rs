# Pricing Tier

Determines the base pricing tier by combining credit grade, collateral
adequacy, debt service coverage, sector risk, and accounts quality.
Uses **PRIORITY** hit policy — first matching rule wins, so rules are
ordered from best tier to worst.

Any upstream "Decline" result propagates as a decline here. The DSCR
hard floor of 1.0 is also enforced.

Rules 1-5 propagate upstream declines. Rules 6-25 form the pricing
matrix. Rule 26 catches E-grade applicants with insufficient collateral
or DSCR — outside appetite.
