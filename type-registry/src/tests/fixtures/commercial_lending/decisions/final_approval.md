# Final Approval

Determines the lending decision by combining all upstream assessments.
Uses **FIRST** hit policy — declines are checked first, then referrals,
then approvals by tier.

This is the penultimate decision in the graph. Its output feeds into
the Conditions of Approval table, which attaches covenants and
monitoring requirements to approved or referred facilities.

Rules 1-4 are automatic system declines. Rules 5-6 are auto-approvals
for the best-quality applications. Rule 16 ensures sole traders
requesting over 2M always go to the board. Rule 17 is the catch-all —
anything that doesn't match a specific rule gets referred to the
credit committee for manual review.
