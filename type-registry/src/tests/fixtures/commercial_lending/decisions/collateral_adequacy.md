# Collateral Adequacy

Combines the LTV ratio with the property risk rating to determine whether
the collateral is sufficient security for the facility. Uses **UNIQUE**
hit policy.

The LTV thresholds vary by property risk — a low-risk prime office can
support higher leverage than a high-risk industrial unit.

Rules 1-3 are hard stops inherited from the policy: unacceptable property,
LTV above 85%, or development above 65% LTV are automatic declines.
