# Conditions of Approval

Attaches covenants, monitoring requirements, and special conditions to
approved or referred facilities. Uses **COLLECT** hit policy — all
matching rules fire and their conditions accumulate into a list.

A declined application produces no conditions. Every approved or
referred facility gets at least one condition (the annual review in
rule 16 is a universal requirement).

Rule 1 is a no-op for declined applications (COLLECT ignores null
outputs). Rule 16 fires for every approved or referred facility — it's
the universal annual review condition. A typical T4 facility with
marginal collateral and borderline DSCR might accumulate 6-8 conditions.
